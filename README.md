- 👋 Hi, I’m @AllysonKAndrade, a PhD student at the University of Guelph
- 👀 I’m interested in factors contributing to the development and maintainence of substance use disorder
- 🧠 I am studying the effect of internally perceived (i.e., interoceptive) cue-dependent learning with an opioid agonist on neural activation in brain regions associated with learning, reward, perception, memory and motor output, and the functional connectivity of those regions. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to conduct a brain-wide network analysis using R
- 💞️ I welcome advice and useful learning material from experts to accomplish this!
- 📫 How to reach me: aandra02@uoguelph.ca
